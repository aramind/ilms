## 📝 Description

iLMS is a full-stack web application I developed for use in my classes at PUP-M. It provides a centralized platform where:

### 👩‍🏫 Teachers can:
- Create and manage courses
- Upload materials (PDFs, links, video lectures, and exams)
- Monitor student performance and activity

### 👨‍🎓 Students can:
- Enroll in courses
- Access all learning materials in one place—anytime, anywhere
- Track progress throughout each course

Progress is individually saved, allowing both teachers and students to monitor submissions, activity, and course completion over time.

### 🚧 In Development:
- Notifications  
- Announcements  
- Calendar integration  
- File upload functionality
- Notes Creation and Storage
- Messaging inside the app
